			<h3>Mass Shootings and Injuries Caused by Mass Shootings Has Been on the Rise</h3>
			<img src="img-final.jpeg" alt="Picture of flowers to mourn those lost in recent mass shootings">
			<p>From 2018 to the present, data has shown a general increase in mass shootings each year. This is a horrifying trend that goes hand in hand with the data showing an increased number of people harmed - both injured and killed - by mass shootings each year. When speaking with Mark Bryant, the Founder and Executive Director of the Gun Violence Archive, with fellow classmate Noah Love, he stated that along with watching mass shootings, his corporation has also been watching how “when the sale of AK47s and AR15s goes up, crime goes up.” Bryant also explained that “what we’re seeing is a proliferation of extended magazine shootings…having a pistol with a 30-round magazine or having an AR15 or AK47 with 30, 60, 90-round magazines…we’re seeing more and more fatalities and injuries from individual shootings, that tells me it’s the magazines doing it because it’s so easy to spray an area when you have 30 rounds and you fire the gun as fast you can pull your finger.”

			<h3>Red States vs. Blue States</h3>
			<p>Using the data from the Gun Violence Archive I was able to calculate the rate of mass shootings and those harmed during mass shootings per 100,000 people in each state. I was then able to compare the rates of some known red states and blue states. The distinction between red states and blue states is important here as red states are known to have more relaxed gun control laws and blue states tend to have stricter gun control laws. For example, California, a blue state, had less than one mass shooting per 100,000 people, meanwhile, Louisiana, a red state, had three mass shootings per 100,000 people. It is important to note that there are blue states that have more mass shootings than some red states but overall trends show that red states have more mass shootings than blue states. According to <a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/higher-rates-of-mass-shootings-in-us-states-with-more-relaxed-gun-control-laws/">BMJ, an international research journal</a>, "US states with more relaxed gun control laws and higher rates of gun ownership have higher rates of mass shootings…and the gap in the rate of mass shootings between these states and those with more restrictive laws seems to have widened in recent years.” Bryant has come to the same conclusion, saying that “the red states that have fewer laws, they are growing fast as far as numbers of shootings are concerned.” </p> 
			<p>My interest in the red state vs. blue state conversation had been peaked for a while, so I took a closer look at rates of the number of people harmed in mass shootings in each region of the United States per 100,000 people and how many states in that region were red states, blue states, and swing states. The Midwest which had the highest number of harmed per 100,000 people, more than five per 100,000 people, contains four swing states, seven red states, and one blue state. The South which had the second highest number, around five harmed per 100,000 people, contains three swing states, ten red states, and four blue states. The Northeast which had the second smallest number, around three harmed per 100,000 people, contains one swing state, no red states, and eight blue states. Lastly, the West which had the smallest number, contains two swing states, five red states, and six blue states. This data shows the correlation that the regions with more red states have a higher number of people harmed in mass shootings and the regions with more blue states have a lower number of people harmed. The data also shows that this trend is the same when comparing the number of mass shootings per region.

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>To fully understand the data, it is important to note that the FBI does not have a definition for mass shootings, they only have a definition for mass murder. The FBI’s definition of mass murder is four or more people killed. The Gun Violence Archive defines mass shootings as four or more people injured or killed.</p>
			<p>There are so many more ways that the data can be analyzed or taken a closer look at. In the future, it would be interesting to research specifically which states have stricter gun control laws and which states have more relaxed gun control laws, then do a deeper dive into the number harmed and number of mass shootings in these states. Additionally, it would be interesting to analyze this data with data that shows the sale of guns such as AK47s and AR15s.</p>
			<p>Either way, the data shows a very clear pattern. United States lawmakers need to take a closer look at this data and realize the importance of gun control laws for the safety of the people. There have been so many mass shootings in the news recently; it is heartbreaking and so terribly scary. And there are even more mass shootings that don’t get a lot of attention in the news. Changes have to take place to make America a safer place to live. As Mark Bryant said, “Too many people are getting shot.”</p>
